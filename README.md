# Sentiment Analysis using Neural Networks

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project aims to classify text sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) using a neural network model built with TensorFlow and Keras. It processes text data and applies deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, padding)
- Neural network training for classification
- Model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score
- Graphical representation of training progress (loss & accuracy)
